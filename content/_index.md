  title : "About Me"
  image : "images/Andrew.png"
  content : "My name is Andrew Zammit-Mangion and I am an Associate Professor in Statistics with the National Institute for Applied Statistics Research Australia (NIASRA) at the University of Wollongong. I completed my PhD in 2012 at the University of Sheffield, UK in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering before carrying out brief post-docs at the University of Edinburgh with the School of Informatics and the University of Bristol with the Department of Maths and the School of Geographical Sciences. I joined NIASRA in 2014 and have been here ever since!

\

This page highlights some of the key projects I have participated in with some great students and collaborators as part of the Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) that I was awarded in 2017, titled ``Deep space-time models for modelling complex environmental phenomena'' (see Collaborators and Students). The DECRA was invaluable in giving me the time to explore some ideas that I had for several years since my time in the UK, and to connect with several international researchers. Please take a browse of the below projects; the synopsis for each project is left to be deliberately short, and clicking on `Read more' will direct you to a published work with more details.

      content : "Nonstationarity in spatial processes can be constructed by warping space and subsequently defining a stationary process on the warped domain. In this project, together with [James Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2ahoJIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Quan Vu](https://quanvu17.wordpress.com/), and [Maurizio Filippone](https://www.eurecom.fr/~filippon/),  we describe a warping approach that allows for straightforward fitting and prediction with univariate spatial data. The model, uses low-dimensional injective warping functions which can either be estimated using maximum likelihood or inferred using stochastic variational Bayes. "

Here, we model the joint processes using stationary, symmetric, covariance functions on the warped domain. There are many interesting properties that arise when modelling nonstationarity and asymmetry in this way; see main text for more details."

      content : "Dynamic spatio-temporal models are often used to model highly dynamic geophysical or ecological processes, such as daily sea-surface temperature or the spread of an invading species. Often, the dynamics themselves (e.g., the direction of flow) changes rapidly in both space and time. In this project, together with [Chris Wikle](), we integrate a convolution neural network with a statistical spatio-temporal model to jointly predict the spatio-temporal varying dynamical parameters and the process of interest."

In this project led by [James Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2ahoJIAAAAJ&hl=en), we use normalising flows to estimate the intensity function of a non-homogeneous Poisson process on the plane. We also show that the modelling architecture we use exhibits an attractive universal approximation property."

Here, in this project led by [James Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2ahoJIAAAAJ&hl=en), we use radial flows within a measure transport framework to constuct a flexible model for the intensity function of a non-homogeneous point process on the sphere."

In this project, led by [Laura Cartwright](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CMee9DIAAAAJ&hl=en), we take advantage of spatial and temporal correlations of the numerical-model output to emulate outputs at other, new, input locations. Emulation is done on a small-dimensional space constructed via a convolutional variational autoencoder. "

However, in order to take advantage of the information in big data sets, one also needs to use more complex models. Here, together with [Jonathan Rougier](https://www.rougierconsulting.com/), we construct a model using multiple spatial scales, where the degree of spatial nonstationarity is allowed to increase with decreasing process scale."
